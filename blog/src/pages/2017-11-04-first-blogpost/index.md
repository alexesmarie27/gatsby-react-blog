Hello everyone!

This is my first ever blog post, so bear with me through this learning curve. My name is Alexes Presswood, and I am the creator and writer on this unnamed (at the time of writing this) blog. I am a software developer with a love for mobile development, but I also have a love for learning in general. I had never used React before, so that mixed with the fact that I was interested in starting a blog on things that interest me made me create the site you are on now.

I will use this site as a way for me to showcase my interests. I will have coding tutorials, fashion and beauty posts, traveling diaries, and really just anything else that suites my fancy at the time.

Thanks for visiting, and I am excited to post more in the future!

Alexes
